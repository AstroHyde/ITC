# ITC
Adapted ITC code for Magellan by E. A. Hyde. Original starting code from Francesco Di Mille. With contributions from Konstantina Boutsia and Guillermo Blanc. This code compiles across the AAO Apache webserver (private connection) and is a variant of the currently running code at the Magellan site.

See the description regarding the ITC and server set-up in: "ITC_2017_Documentation_eah.docx"
